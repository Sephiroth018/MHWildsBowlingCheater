# MHWildsBowlingCheater

This is a very simple [REFramework](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework) plugin for Monster Hunter Wilds that lets you set a modifier for the points of the pins in the bowling minigame.

The default modifier is 10 and can be changed in REFrameworks `Script Generated UI` section.  
It can also be disabled there.
To prevent frustration for other players the script only works while in single player mode.

### Requirements:

- [REFramework](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework)

### Installation:

- Download the latest release
- Extract it as is into your game directory

### Deinstallation:

- Go into your `game directory/reframework/autorun` folder and delete the following files/directories
  - `BowlingCheater.lua`
  - `BowlingCheater`
- Go into your `game directory/reframework/data` folder and delete the `BowlingCheater` directory

Alternatively you can use Vortex from Nexusmods for managing your mod installation
